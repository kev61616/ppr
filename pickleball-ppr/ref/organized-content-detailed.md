## 3. Grip Techniques

### 3.1 General
The grip used to hold the paddle is a fundamental aspect of playing pickleball effectively for several reasons:

1. Control and Accuracy: A proper grip allows for greater control and accuracy in your shots. It helps in precisely directing the ball, whether you are serving, volleying, or hitting groundstrokes.
2. Power: While pickleball does not rely on power as much as other racquet sports, a good grip can still help in generating more force in your shots, especially for smashes and drives.
3. Reduced Risk of Injury: An appropriate grip can reduce the strain on your wrist, elbow, and shoulder. This is particularly important for avoiding conditions like tennis elbow, which can occur from repetitive strain.
4. Versatility in Shots: A good grip enables you to easily switch between different types of shots, like from a forehand to a backhand, or transitioning from a groundstroke to a volley.
5. Spin: For advanced players, a proper grip is essential for applying different spins to the ball, adding another level of strategy to the game.
6. Comfort: A grip that feels natural and comfortable can improve your overall performance and enjoyment of the game.

To master pickleball, it is important to experiment with different grip styles (like Continental or Eastern) to find what works best for your style of play and ensures comfort during long matches. Regular practice with the correct grip will significantly improve your game.

### 3.2 The Continental Grip
The Continental grip in pickleball is a versatile and widely used grip, especially useful for a variety of shots. It is often referred to as the "hammer grip" due to the way the paddle is held, similar to holding a hammer.

Here are the key elements:

1. Grip Formation: To achieve the Continental grip, place your hand on the paddle handle so that the base knuckle of your index finger and the heel of your hand are aligned with the second bevel of the paddle handle. For a right-handed player, this would be at the 2 o'clock position on the paddle handle, and for a left-handed player, at the 10 o'clock position.

2. Characteristics: This grip aligns the paddle perpendicular to the ground and parallel to the net when your arm is extended. It allows for easy transitions between forehand and backhand strokes without the need to change the grip.

3. Advantages: The Continental grip is particularly effective for serves, volleys, and overhead smashes in pickleball. It provides a natural and balanced position for hitting the ball flat and straight, making it ideal for quick, reflex volleys at the net.

4. Versatility: While the Continental grip offers great control for specific shots, it might be less effective for powerful groundstrokes, where grips like the Eastern might be more suitable. However, its ease of use for both forehand and backhand strokes makes it a favorite among players who prefer a quick and reactive play style, especially in doubles.

5. Transition and Adaptability: Due to its neutral nature, the Continental grip allows players to quickly switch between different types of shots, making it a great choice for fast-paced games where quick reactions are crucial.

In summary, the Continental grip is a fundamental and versatile grip in pickleball, known for its effectiveness in serving, volleying, and smashes. Its balanced and neutral positioning makes it a great choice for players looking for a grip that works well with a variety of shots, especially in fast-paced play scenarios.

### 3.3 The Eastern Grip
The Eastern grip in pickleball is a commonly used grip that offers a good balance between power and control, especially for forehand shots.

Here are the key elements:

1. Positioning: To achieve the Eastern grip, place the palm of your dominant hand so that the base knuckle of your index finger is aligned with the third bevel of the paddle handle. If you imagine the handle as the face of a clock, this would be at the 3 o'clock position for a right-handed player and 9 o'clock for a left-handed player.

2. Grip Formation: The grip is similar to shaking hands with the paddle. Your fingers should be comfortably wrapped around the handle, and the thumb should be placed flat against the other side of the handle.

3. Advantages: The Eastern grip is particularly effective for forehand strokes. It allows for a natural and powerful swing motion and facilitates hitting the ball with a flat paddle face, which is great for driving the ball with power. It also offers a degree of flexibility that enables players to easily switch to other shots or grips as needed.

4. Forehand Orientation: When using the Eastern grip for a forehand shot, the paddle face will be perpendicular to the ground at the point of contact, which helps in achieving depth and power in the shots.

5. Versatility: While the Eastern grip is favored for forehand shots, players can still use it for other types of strokes with some adjustments. However, some players may prefer to switch to a different grip, like the Continental, for backhand strokes or specific shots like dinks or lobs.

In summary, the Eastern grip in pickleball is a popular choice for players who prefer a powerful and controlled forehand stroke. Its natural, handshake-like positioning makes it a comfortable grip for many players, especially those transitioning from sports like tennis.

### 3.4 The V-Shape Grip
The V-Shape grip in pickleball, also known as the "V-Grip," is a specific way of holding the paddle that is quite popular among players.

Here are the key elements:

1. Formation of the V-Shape Grip: This grip is named for the V-Grip formed between the thumb and the index finger on the paddle handle. When you grip the paddle, the base of your thumb and the side of your index finger create a V-Grip.

2. Position on the Paddle: The V-Grip should align with the edge of the paddle. This alignment helps in maintaining a neutral position, which is beneficial for both forehand and backhand shots.

3. Benefits: The V-Grip is known for providing a good balance of control and power. It allows for easier wrist movement, which is crucial for imparting spin and for quick, responsive shots. This grip is especially useful for players who prefer a more finesse-oriented game, as it offers excellent control over the angle of the paddle face and the direction of the ball.

4. Usage: This grip is used primarily for baseline strokes and serves. It is less common for net play or dinking, where a Continental grip might be more effective.

5. Adaptability: While the V-Grip is a fundamental grip in pickleball, players often adjust their grip slightly depending on the shot they are executing. For example, they might shift to a more forehand or backhand dominant grip when necessary.

In summary, the V-Shape Grip is a versatile and popular grip in pickleball, offering a good mix of control and power, and is especially effective for baseline play and serves. As with any sport, the choice of grip can be highly personal and depends on the style of play, comfort, and the specific demands of the game.

## 5. Opening the Lesson

### 5.1 Introduction
Here is where the coach will facilitate introductions allowing players several minutes each to tell their name, from where they traveled or where they live, any pre-existing injuries, and a little about past sports history, if any. From there, the coach will move into the warm-up.

### 5.2 Warm-Up

#### 5.2.1 Athlete Activation
To activate an athlete means to prepare them physically and mentally before a sports event or training session. The activation process is aimed at priming the athlete's body and mind for optimal performance. It typically involves a series of exercises, drills, and activities that increase heart rate, enhance focus, mobilize muscles, and improve overall readiness.

Physical activation generally involves dynamic movements like jumping, running, or agility exercises to warm up muscles, increase blood flow, and improve flexibility. This helps prevent injuries, increase range of motion, and optimize performance during the event.

An example of physical athlete activation is to have players jog from the baseline to the net starting at 20% effort and then back to the baseline from the net at 40% effort and then from the baseline to the net again but this time at 60% effort and then from the net to the baseline again, this time at 100% effort. One could also have players do jumping jacks or skip rope for a more dynamic start. This will engage the athletes and begin to get their heart rate up and their blood pumping!

#### 5.2.2 Dynamic Stretching
Warming up properly before playing pickleball is crucial to prepare your body for the physical activity, enhance performance, and reduce the risk of injuries. Perform dynamic stretches to improve mobility and flexibility. Focus on major muscle groups such as legs, arms, back, and shoulders.

Here are some examples of dynamic stretches:

1. Hip Openers (open and closed)
2. Arm Circles
3. Torso Twists
4. 60-40% Lunges
5. Monster Walks
6. Butt Kicks

#### 5.2.3 Athletic Skill Build
To build or reinforce an athletic skill, have students toss and catch a decompressed tennis ball from the area of the court as a part of the overall warm-up.

#### 5.2.4 Paddle Hits
Start with gentle dinking at the net, gradually moving back to the baseline. Practice a variety of shots including dinks, volleys, 3rd shot drops and drives, serves, and return of serve gradually increasing intensity.

A common paddle warm-up could include the following components:

1. Shadow swings: Mimic pickleball strokes using your paddle without a ball. Perform forehand and backhand swings, emphasizing proper technique and incorporating footwork.
2. Forehand and Backhand Dinks: Practice hitting soft, controlled shots (dinks) off both sides with a focus on consistency and accuracy.
3. Volley Drills: Work on volleys near the net by practicing quick reflexes, soft hands and proper paddle positioning. This is typically done with a partner or against a wall.
4. 3rd Shot Drops/Drives: Work on hitting 3rd shot drops from the baseline to the Non-Volley Zone, aiming to land the ball softly and close to the net or low enough that the partner has to hit up on the shot.
5. Serve and Return of Serve Practice: Players work on their serve technique and practice returning serves with a focus on consistency and accuracy.

It is important to note that the specific warm up routine may vary depending on individual preferences and skill levels. The goal of a paddle warm up is to prepare the body and mind for pickleball play, reduce the risk of injuries, and improve overall performance on the court.

Once the paddle warm-up is complete, coaches will put players in OPEN competitive play. This will provide the coach with an opportunity to observe students in a score-keeping game situation. It is important that this be competitive so that the coach can do a true skill assessment of all players.

## 6. Skill Development

This section represents the CLOSED section of the Hourglass format where we will introduce and teach several shots that are appropriate for players moving from the 3.5 to 4.0 level.

### 6.1 Swing Volley
This is a dynamic shot that combines elements of both a volley and a groundstroke. The Swing Volley is hit out of the air with a full swing, usually while standing near the NVZ. This is a versatile shot that can be used to put pressure on the opponents, create angles, or hit winners.

#### 6.1.1 Technique
Swing Volley technique in pickleball is crucial for effectively hitting the ball out of the air before it bounces on the court. This shot is typically executed near the net, typically at or close to the NVZ, but it can also be hit when transitioning. In pickleball, the volley is typically referred to as a "Swing Volley" vs a "Punch Volley" due to the rules of the game and the restrictions of the NVZ. However, there are times when the height of the ball allows for more punch than swing on a volley.

Proper swing volley technique involves several key components for both control and power:

1. Position: Stand with your knees slightly bent, weight on the balls of your feet, and paddle held in front of you at chest level. This position allows for quick movements and reactions.

2. Grip and Paddle Position: Hold the paddle with a firm yet relaxed grip. The paddle face should be open (angled slightly upwards) for most volleys to ensure the ball clears the net.

3. Minimal Backswing: Unlike groundstrokes, volleys require very little backswing. The power comes from the speed of the ball and a firm, controlled movement of the paddle.

4. Paddle Movement: Use a short, slight swinging motion for the volley. The movement is more about guiding the ball rather than winding up and swinging hard.

5. Contact Point: Make contact with the ball in front of your body. This helps with accuracy and control.

6. Follow Through: Keep the follow-through short and controlled. Overextending can lead to loss of control over the shot. Return to neutral to be prepared for the next shot.

7. Non-Dominant Hand: Use your body to add power to the volley, especially for aggressive volleys. This involves a slight forward movement of the body and a transfer of weight from the back foot to the front foot.

8. Shot Placement: Aim your volleys deliberately, whether you are trying to hit them away from your opponent or into difficult-to-reach areas.

9. Quick Feet: Good footwork is essential. Be ready to move quickly to position yourself optimally for each volley.

10. Anticipation and Reaction: Be alert and ready to react quickly to your opponents' shots, as volleys often occur in fast-paced exchanges. Mastering volley technique is essential for success in pickleball, especially in aggressive net play. It allows a player to take charge of the rally, creating opportunities for winning points and putting pressure on the opponents.

#### 6.1.2 Consistency
Volley consistency refers to the ability to reliably and effectively execute volley shots throughout a game or match. Consistency in volleying is crucial for maintaining control during rallies and effectively countering the opponents' play.

Key elements of volley consistency include:

1. Controlled Shot Placement: Regularly placing volleys accurately, whether it is directing them to specific areas of the court to challenge opponents or keeping them away from opponents' strengths. As the level of play increases, consistency evolves from number of shots in the court to number of shots to a specific target.

2. Steady Paddle Work: Maintaining a firm wrist and stable paddle face when contacting the ball, which is essential for controlling the direction and speed of the volley.

3. Positioning and Footwork: Being in the right position to effectively volley, which often means staying close to the NVZ line. Good footwork is essential for quick adjustments.

4. Adaptability: The ability to adjust volleys based on the pace and angle of the incoming ball, as well as to the positioning and playing style of the opponents.

5. Reduced Errors: Consistently executing volleys without faults like hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds.

6. Strategic Awareness: Understanding when to use a soft, controlled volley to reset the point or a hard, aggressive volley to take control of the rally.

Developing volley consistency is important for pickleball players at all skill levels, as it provides a reliable foundation for both defensive and offensive play at the net. A player who can consistently volley well is often able to dictate the pace and flow of the game.

#### 6.1.3 Accuracy
Volley accuracy refers to the precision with which a player executes their volley shots. Accuracy in volleying is crucial for placing the ball effectively to challenge opponents, control the point, and minimize the risk of unforced errors.

Key aspects of volley accuracy include:

1. Precise Placement: Skillfully directing the ball to targeted areas of the court, whether it is to exploit an opponents' weaknesses, keep opponents off-balance, or set up for a winning shot.

2. Controlled Angles: The ability to manage the angle of the paddle and the point of contact to guide the ball accurately, whether for cross-court shots, down-the-line shots, or sharp angles.

3. Depth Control: The ability to hit the volley with enough depth to make it challenging for opponents to return, but with the control needed to keep the ball in play.

4. Strategic Shot Selection: Choosing the right type of volley (soft touch volley to drop the ball in the kitchen, or a hard drive volley for an aggressive play) based on the dynamics of the rally and the positioning of the opponents.

5. Adjusting to Ball Speed and Spin: Modifying the volley technique to accommodate the incoming ball pace and spin, ensuring accurate returns.

6. Consistency Under Pressure: Maintaining accuracy even in high-pressure situations or during fast-paced exchanges at the net.

Improving volley accuracy is important for players looking to enhance their performance in pickleball, as it allows for more control over rallies and increases the likelihood of winning points through strategic shot placement.

#### 6.1.4 Blocking
Blocking refers to a defensive shot used to neutralize an opponent's powerful or aggressive shot, particularly a smash or a hard-driven ball. The goal of a block shot is to absorb the power of the incoming ball and return it gently over the net, ideally placing it in a way that makes it difficult for the opponent to attack again. This shot is crucial when you are at the net and need to defend against fast-paced volleys or smashes. Key aspects of blocking in pickleball include:

1. Soft Hands: Relaxing your grip on the paddle and using soft hands is essential. This allows the paddle to absorb some of the energy from the ball, reducing the speed as it rebounds.

2. Paddle Position: Keep your paddle up and in front of you, positioned between your body and the net. This ready position allows for quick reaction to fast shots.

3. Minimal Movement: A block shot requires very little paddle movement. It is more about positioning the paddle correctly and allowing the ball to hit the paddle, rather than swinging at the ball.

4. Angle of the Paddle: Slightly angle the paddle face upwards to ensure the ball clears the net. The angle also helps to control the direction of the block volley.

5. Body Position: Stay balanced with your knees slightly bent. Move your body as a unit to align with the ball, rather than just reaching with your arm.

6. Strategic Placement: Aim to place your block shot where it will be most challenging for the opponent to attack again, often in the NVZ or at their feet.

7. Controlled Follow Through: The follow-through should be minimal to maintain control over the shot.

8. Quick Recovery: After executing the block, be prepared to quickly respond to the next shot, as effective blocking often leads to continued volley exchanges.

Blocking is a skill that requires practice, as it involves precise timing and control, especially when dealing with powerful shots. Mastering this technique can significantly enhance your defensive play in pickleball.

#### 6.1.5 Counter Attack
Counter attacking refers to the strategy of responding aggressively to an opponent's attack, turning a defensive situation into an offensive opportunity. This involves quickly and decisively returning a strong shot from an opponent, often catching them off-guard and potentially winning the point.

Key aspects of counter attacking in pickleball include:

1. Quick Reaction: Counter attacking requires fast reflexes to respond to an incoming aggressive shot from the opponent.

2. Strategic Placement: Aim your counter attack where it is most difficult for the opponent to return, such as at their feet, in open court areas, or toward the weaker side.

3. Using Opponent's Pace: A counter-attack often involves using the speed of the opponent's shot to your advantage. By effectively redirecting this power, you can create a strong return with less physical effort.

4. Paddle Readiness: Keep your paddle up and in a ready position, allowing for a quick transition from a defensive to an offensive shot.

5. Body Positioning: The ability to stay balanced and ready to move. Good footwork is crucial in positioning yourself optimally for a counter-attack.

6. Shot Selection: Decide quickly whether to use a hard drive, a volley, or a more strategic placement shot as your counter-attack.

7. Mental Composure: Maintain focus and calmness during high-pressure situations, as counter-attacking often occurs during fast-paced exchanges.

8. Aggressive Play: Counter attacking is an assertive strategy. It requires confidence and the willingness to take risks during critical moments in the game.

Effective counter attacking in pickleball can shift the momentum of a point, putting pressure back on the opponent and often leading to winning shots. It is a skill that combines technical ability with strategic awareness and mental agility.

#### 6.1.6 Handling Power
Handling power when volleying in pickleball refers to effectively managing and responding to powerful volleys from your opponents. It involves techniques and strategies to control and neutralize these fast, forceful shots rather than being overwhelmed by them. This skill is crucial in maintaining a competitive edge during high-paced exchanges at the net.

Key aspects of handling power while volleying include:

1. Soft Hands: This means using a relaxed grip and a gentle touch to absorb the power of the incoming shot, reducing its speed as you return it. Think of the paddle as a cushion that deadens the impact.

2. Paddle Positioning: Keeping the paddle up and in front of you, ready to quickly react to powerful shots. Good anticipation and preparation are essential.

3. Body Position and Balance: Maintaining a balanced, stable stance allows for quick, controlled movements. Positioning your body effectively to intercept powerful volleys is crucial.

4. Short, Controlled Strokes: Instead of a full swing, use short, compact strokes to return powerful volleys. This helps in maintaining control over the return shot.

5. Block Volleys: A block volley is a defensive shot where the paddle is used to block the ball back into the opponent's court, using the power of the incoming shot to your advantage.

6. Angle and Placement: Redirect the power of the shot by angling your paddle, sending the ball away from the opponent or into difficult areas of the court.

7. Strategic Depth: Aim your volleys deep in the opponents' court or softly into the NVZ, depending on the situation. Depth can help neutralize the advantage of a power volley especially when in transition.

8. Mental Composure: Stay calm and focused. Handling power volleys well often requires quick thinking and adaptability under pressure.

Handling power when volleying effectively is a blend of technical skill, strategic thinking, and mental composure. It is about using the incoming power/pace to your advantage, either by neutralizing their shots or redirecting the shots in ways that challenge the opponents in return.

### 6.2 The Lob

#### 6.2.1 Technique
Lob technique refers to the specific method and skills used to execute a lob shot effectively. A lob is a strategic play where the ball is hit in a high arc over the opponents, ideally landing deep in their court. Proper technique is crucial for making the lob a successful and reliable part of the game.

Key aspects of good lob technique include:

1. Stance and Footwork: Start with a balanced stance, ready to step into the shot. Good footwork is essential to position yourself correctly for the lob.

2. Grip and Paddle Positioning: Hold the paddle with a relaxed grip. The paddle face should be open (tilted slightly backwards) to create the necessary lift and arc.

3. Backswing and Point of Contact: A smooth, controlled backswing helps in generating the right amount of power. The ball should be struck in front of your body, with the point of contact being slightly under the ball to lift it.

4. Upward Swing Path: Swing the paddle in an upward motion, imparting both forward momentum and lift to the ball. This creates the high arc needed for the lob.

5. Follow Through: A proper follow-through is critical. Continue the upward motion of your swing after hitting the ball, guiding it on the desired path.

6. Visual and Tactical Awareness: Be aware of your opponents' positions. The best time to hit a lob is typically when they are close to the net and may not have enough time to backtrack.

7. Control and Precision: Practice controlling the depth and height of the lob. The goal is to make it land deep in the opponents' court without going out of bounds.

8. Adjusting to Conditions: Be ready to adjust your lob technique based on factors like wind, the style of play, and your position on the court.

Developing a solid lob technique can be a game-changer in pickleball, providing a strategic tool to counter aggressive net play and to create opportunities for offensive shots.

#### 6.2.2 Consistency
Lob consistency refers to the ability to reliably and effectively execute lob shots over the course of a game or match. Lobbing consistently means being able to perform this shot effectively under various conditions and throughout the duration of play.

Achieving consistency in lob shots involves several key aspects:

1. Accurate Placement: Regularly placing the lob where it is intended, such as deep in the opponents' court, away from their reach.

2. Controlled Arc and Depth: Ensuring the ball travels with the right trajectory – high enough to clear the opponents, but not so high that it goes out of bounds or gives them ample time to position themselves.

3. Adaptability: Adjusting the lob based on the opponents' positioning, style of play, and the current state of the game, while still maintaining control and accuracy.

4. Reduced Errors: Minimizing faults like hitting the ball too short (making it easy for opponents to smash), too long (going out of bounds), or too low (allowing opponents to easily intercept).

5. Strategic Usage: Understanding when to use a lob to maximize its effectiveness, such as when opponents are positioned aggressively at the net.

Developing lob consistency is crucial for players who want to add a layer of strategic depth to their game. A well-executed lob can shift the momentum of a rally, force opponents out of their preferred positions, and create offensive opportunities.

#### 6.2.3 Accuracy
Lob accuracy refers to the precision with which a player executes lob shots. Accurate lobs are crucial for making the shot effective and minimizing the risk of easy counterattacks.

Key elements of lob accuracy include:

1. Placement: Hitting the lob so that it lands in the desired area of the court, ideally deep and close to the baseline, and away from the opponents' reach.

2. Controlled Trajectory: Ensuring the lob has the right arc – high enough to clear the opponents, especially if they are at the net, but not so high that it gives them time to reposition or results in the ball going out of bounds.

3. Depth Management: The lob should have sufficient depth to prevent opponents from easily smashing or attacking the ball, but also needs to be controlled to avoid going beyond the baseline.

4. Adjusting to Conditions: Being able to execute accurate lobs in different playing conditions, such as against different types of opponents, in various court and weather conditions, and under different levels of pressure.

5. Purposeful Use: Employing the lob strategically, understanding when it is the best option and using it to create opportunities or disrupt the opponents' game plan.

Lob accuracy is a valuable skill in pickleball, as it can effectively neutralize aggressive net play, create openings, and shift the momentum of the game. It requires practice and good judgment to master.

#### 6.2.4 Offensive Lob
An offensive lob in pickleball is a strategic shot used to move the opponents out of their preferred position, especially when they are at the NVZ and playing aggressively. Unlike a defensive lob, which is often used as a last resort to reset the point, an offensive lob is a proactive shot intended to gain a tactical advantage.

Characteristics of an offensive lob include:

1. Surprise Element: It is often used unexpectedly to catch opponents off-guard, particularly when they are positioned close to the net and might not be prepared to move back quickly.

2. Placement and Trajectory: The offensive lob is typically aimed deep into the opponents' court, forcing them to turn and move back towards their baseline. The trajectory is usually lower and faster than a defensive lob, reducing the opponents' time to react.

3. Purpose: The primary goal is to create an offensive opportunity. By pushing the opponents back, it opens up the court and can lead to a weak return that can be exploited for an attacking shot.

4. Skill and Precision: Effective offensive lobs require good control and accuracy. The shot needs to be high enough to pass over the opponents but precise enough to stay within the boundaries of the court.

Using offensive lobs effectively requires practice and an understanding of the opponents' positioning and weaknesses. When executed well, it can be a powerful tool in a pickleball arsenal, shifting the dynamics of the game and creating scoring opportunities.

#### 6.2.5 Defending the Lob
Positioning yourself for a lob in pickleball involves anticipating and preparing for a high, arcing shot that an opponent sends over your head towards the back of the court. Proper positioning and readiness for a lob are crucial for effective defense and counterplay.

Key aspects of defending the overhead include:

1. Anticipation: Pay attention to your opponent's body language and paddle position, as these can often indicate a lob is coming. If an opponent is under pressure or in a defensive position, they may be more likely to attempt a lob.

2. Court Positioning: Generally, you want to be positioned closer to the NVZ line for most play in pickleball. However, be aware of standing too close to the net, which makes you more vulnerable to lobs. A good rule of thumb is to be just behind the NVZ line, allowing you enough space to move back for a lob without being too far from the net for regular volleys and dinks.

3. Ready Stance: Keep a balanced and ready stance. You should be on the balls of your feet, knees slightly bent, ready to move in any direction quickly. This stance allows for a player to swiftly turn and run sideways toward the baseline if needed.

4. Backward Movement: If a lob is hit, turn and move back toward the baseline to track the ball. It is important to turn your body so that you can run backwards efficiently while still keeping your eyes on the ball.

5. Paddle Readiness: Keep your paddle up and ready as you move. This ensures you are prepared to return the lob, either with an overhead smash, if the lob is short, or off the bounce if the lob is deep.

6. Communication in Doubles: In doubles play, communication with your partner is key. Quickly call out who will take the lob to avoid confusion and ensure one of you is ready to hit an effective return.

7. Depth Judgment: Practice judging the depth of lobs. With experience, you will be able to quickly determine whether a lob is going out of bounds or if it needs to be played.

8. Transitioning After the Lob: Once you handle the lob, move quickly back into position. The goal is to regain your position near the NVZ line to be ready for the next play.

Being prepared for a lob involves not only physical readiness but also mental anticipation and strategic positioning. It is about finding the right balance between being close enough to the net for aggressive play and far enough back to cover lobs effectively. Regular practice and experience will enhance your ability to read the game and position yourself optimally.

### 6.3 Overhead

#### 6.3.1 Overhead Safety
Playing pickleball safely, especially during overhead shots and while defending against them, is crucial. Prior to teaching this shot it is recommended that you talk with your students about the proper way to prepare for an overhead.

Here are some safety tips for both scenarios:

1. Proper Stance: Maintain a balanced stance with your feet shoulder-width apart. This helps in maintaining balance and reduces the risk of falling or straining muscles.

2. Watch the Ball: Keep your eye on the ball until you make contact. This helps in accurately hitting the ball and avoiding wild swings that could lead to injury.

3. Use Correct Technique: Bend your knees slightly, and rotate your hips and shoulders into the shot. This ensures that you use your body's full range of motion, reducing the stress on any single joint or muscle.

4. Paddle Control: Grip your paddle firmly but not too tightly. A death grip on the paddle can lead to wrist and arm strain.

5. Avoid Overreaching: Do not stretch beyond your comfortable range of motion, as this can lead to muscle strains or loss of balance.

6. Clear Space: Ensure there is enough space around you to swing freely without hitting other players or objects.

#### 6.3.2 Executing the Overhead
Executing an effective overhead shot in pickleball is a key skill, particularly useful for putting away high balls or returning lob shots.

Key elements of an overhead include:

1. Identify the Opportunity: Watch for a lob or high ball from your opponent. An effective overhead shot is typically executed in response to these kinds of shots.

2. Position Yourself: Quickly move into position under the ball. Your goal is to hit the ball at its highest point where you can comfortably reach it. Ideally, you want to be slightly behind the ball so you can move forward into the shot.

3. Stance: Adopt a balanced, slightly side-on stance. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with the foot opposite your paddle hand slightly forward. This position allows for good balance and power generation. When moving backwards to hit an overhead off of a deep lob, the sideways shuffle (left over right for a right-handed player, right over left for a left-handed player) is critical. Avoid moving backwards from a front-facing position as this is dangerous and can result in falling down. If the lob is too deep, it is recommended that players leave / let it go vs risking injury.

4. Grip: Use a Continental grip (like holding a hammer) for better control and power. This grip is versatile for both forehands and backhands.

5. Backswing: Raise your paddle back and up with your arm bent at the elbow. The paddle should be above and slightly behind your head. Your non-paddle hand can be used to help track the ball and maintain balance.

6. Eye on the Ball: Keep your eyes on the ball all the way through the shot. This helps with timing and accuracy.

7. Step and Swing: As the ball descends, step forward with your front foot, transferring your weight from back to front. Uncoil your body, starting from your legs, then hips, and finally your arm to swing the paddle forward.

8. Point of Contact: Strike the ball above and in front of your head. The best contact point is usually slightly out in front of your body, allowing for a strong, downward trajectory.

9. Follow Through: After making contact, follow through with your swing, letting your arm continue its motion towards your target. This ensures power and direction.

10. Recovery: After the shot, quickly return to a ready position, preparing for the next play.

Remember, like any shot in pickleball, practice is key. Work on your overhead shots regularly to improve your power, accuracy, and consistency. Additionally, always be mindful of your opponents' position – a well-executed overhead shot can be a game changer.

#### 6.3.3 Defending the Overhead
When defending an overhead shot in pickleball, follow these safety tips:

1. Anticipate and Position: Try to anticipate where the ball will land and position yourself accordingly. Being too close to the net or too far back can make it difficult to defend effectively.

2. Ready Stance: Stay on the balls of your feet with knees slightly bent, ready to move in any direction. This 'ready stance' allows for quick movements and better balance.

3. Use the Paddle for Protection: If the ball is coming at you at a high speed, use your paddle to shield your face and body. Hold the paddle in front of you with both hands if necessary.

4. Do not Sacrifice Safety for the Point: If you cannot safely return the ball, it is better to let it go than to risk injury by making an awkward or dangerous play.

5. Communication: If playing doubles, communicate with your partner to avoid collisions or confusion over who will take the shot.

6. Wear Protective Gear: Especially for beginners or in competitive play, consider wearing protective eyewear to guard against accidental hits.

Remember, while pickleball is a competitive sport, safety should always come first. Proper technique, awareness of your surroundings, and respect for your own limits and those of other players are key to a safe and enjoyable game.

#### 6.3.4 Overhead Placement
When executing an overhead shot in pickleball, choosing the right target area is crucial for maximizing effectiveness.

Here are some strategic tips to consider when deciding where to hit the overhead:

1. Aim Deep: Targeting the backcourt is often a good strategy, as it pushes your opponents back and makes it harder for them to return with an aggressive shot. Deep shots can also lead to more errors from your opponents.

2. Hit to Weakness: Pay attention to your opponents' style of play. If one player is weaker on the backhand side, for example, target that area. Exploiting your opponent's weaknesses can give you a significant advantage.

3. Middle of the Court: Hitting the ball down the middle can be effective, especially in doubles play. It can create confusion between the two opponents as to who should take the shot and can lead to unforced errors.

4. Avoid Predictability: Mix up your shots to keep your opponents guessing. If you continually hit in the same pattern, your opponents will anticipate your shots and position themselves accordingly.

5. Consider the Angle: Overhead shots hit at an angle can be more challenging to return than those hit straight on. Angled shots force your opponent to cover more court and can open up the court for your next shot.

6. Baseline Corners: Targeting the corners of the baseline can be effective, especially if your opponent is slower to move. These shots can be harder to reach and return effectively.

7. Watch Your Opponents' Positioning: Be aware of where your opponents are on the court. If they are out of position, hitting the ball to the open space can be a smart play.

8. Force a High Return: If you are not confident in scoring directly from the overhead, aim for a deep and powerful shot that forces your opponent to return a high ball, setting you up for a winning shot on the next play.

9. Control and Power Balance: While power is an advantage in overhead shots, control is equally important. Aim for a spot where you can hit forcefully while maintaining accuracy.

10. Use Spin Wisely: Adding spin to your overhead shots can make them more difficult to return. Topspin can cause the ball to dip quickly, while backspin can make it die down and not bounce as high.

Remember, the effectiveness of your shot also depends on your skill level and the specific situation in a match. Practice various shots and strategies to become versatile and unpredictable on the court.

### 6.4 Around the Post (ATP)

#### 6.4.1 Technique
The "Around the Post" shot, often abbreviated as "ATP", is a spectacular and challenging shot in pickleball that involves hitting the ball around the net post to land it in the opponent's court. This shot is used when the ball is moving at a sharp angle, close to the sideline outside the court; hitting the ball over the net conventionally would result in an out-of-bounds shot.

Key elements of the ATP include:

1. Positioning: To set up for an ATP shot, you typically need to be positioned near the sideline, and the ball should be coming towards you at an angle that would make it difficult to hit over the net directly.

2. Swing and Contact: As the ball approaches, you will need to perform a wide and sweeping swing motion. Your goal is to make contact with the ball as it reaches the side of the net post. You should hit the ball at the lowest possible point before it bounces for a second time, angling it so that it travels around the net post.

3. Clearing the Net: The ball must clear the net post and remain within the boundaries of the opponent's court. It should land inside the sideline and baseline to be considered a legal shot. The lower and faster the shot, the less likely it is that the opponent will be able to defend the ATP.

4. Positioning: After hitting the ATP shot, you may need to quickly reposition yourself on the court to prepare for the next shot / react to your opponent's response.

The Around the Post (ATP) shot is a high-risk, high-reward shot that requires exceptional timing, accuracy, and court awareness. It is often used for its surprise factor and the difficulty it presents to opponents in reacting to such a shot. When executed successfully, it can be a crowd-pleaser and a great way to win a point. However, it is important to note that the ATP is not a high-percentage shot and is generally not recommended for routine play. In competitive pickleball matches, players typically rely on more conventional shot techniques to maintain control and consistency.

#### 6.4.2 Defending the ATP
Defending the "Around the Post" (ATP) in pickleball requires anticipation, positioning, and quick reflexes.

Key elements to defending the ATP include:

1. Anticipate the Shot: Watch for shots that you or your partner hit that are wide and low, potentially setting up your opponent for an ATP. If the ball is heading wide and has enough pace, be ready for this play.

2. Positioning: If you suspect an ATP shot, immediately move towards the sideline and slightly back from the net. This positioning gives you a better chance to reach a ball that is traveling around the post.

3. Watch the Opponent's Paddle: Pay attention to your opponent's paddle angle and body language. If they are positioning themselves unusually wide and low, they might be setting up for an ATP.

4. Keep Your Paddle Ready: Hold your paddle in front of you and be prepared to react quickly. ATP shots are often fast and low, so quick reflexes are key.

5. Be Mindful of the NVZ: While moving laterally to defend against the ATP, be careful not to step into the NVZ if you plan to volley the ball.

6. Communication in Doubles: In doubles play, communicate with your partner. If one player moves to defend against an ATP, the other should adjust their position to cover the open court.

7. Stay Balanced: Keep your knees bent and your body balanced. Being in a ready position allows for quicker and more effective movement.

8. Expect the Unexpected: ATP shots can sometimes result in unusual angles and spins. Be prepared for the ball to behave differently than a standard shot.

9. Counter with an Angle: If you do get to the ball, consider countering with a sharp angle. Since your opponent is likely out of position after hitting an ATP, a well-placed angled shot can win the point.

Defending the ATP is challenging due to the unique angles and speed of the ball. Effective defense requires quick thinking, good footwork, and the ability to anticipate your opponent's actions. As with many aspects of pickleball, experience and practice are key to improving your defensive response to these shots.

#### 6.4.3 Around the Post Play by Play
The Around the Post (ATP) shot is a specialized shot used in specific circumstances, typically when the ball is traveling wide to the side of the court. Here's a play-by-play explanation of when and why to use the ATP:

1. Ball Trajectory: The ideal situation for an ATP arises when the ball is moving wide, outside the boundaries of the court, typically after a cross-court shot from your opponent.

2. Assessment: Quickly assess if the ball is too wide to hit conventionally over the net while staying within the court boundaries. If hitting over the net would force you to send the ball out of bounds, consider the ATP.

3. Movement: Move quickly to the sideline, positioning yourself to intercept the ball before it bounces a second time or goes too far beyond the court.

4. Execution Decision: Decide if an ATP is feasible based on your position, the ball's path, and the speed of the game. Not all wide balls are candidates for an ATP - sometimes letting the ball go out (if it's heading that way) is the better choice.

5. Shot Execution: Instead of hitting the ball over the net, aim to send it around the net post. The key is to hit the ball low enough that it will pass around the post, not over the net, and still land in the opponent's court.

6. Recovery: After executing the ATP, be prepared to move back into position for the next shot. Since the ATP often catches opponents off-guard, they may not return it, but it's good practice to be ready.

The ATP is a high-risk, high-reward shot. It requires good judgment, quick reflexes, and a bit of creativity. It's not a shot you'll use often, but when the opportunity presents itself, it can be a game-changer, catching your opponents by surprise and potentially winning the point in spectacular fashion. Practice this shot in a controlled setting before attempting it in a competitive match.

### 6.5 Erne

#### 6.5.1 Technique
The Erne is a specialized and advanced shot named after the player who popularized it, Erne Medina. The Erne is a move that involves the player standing close to the sideline and quickly darting to the opposite side of the net post to hit the ball. It is often used as a surprise tactic to intercept and put away a shot that is coming over the net close to the post.

Key elements of the Erne include:

1. Positioning: The player positioning for an Erne usually stands very close to the sideline, near the NVZ. They often anticipate that their opponent will hit a shot that goes near the net post.

2. Quick Movement: When the opponent hits the ball close to the net post and it is headed towards the player's side of the court, they quickly move to the opposite side of the net post while staying outside the NVZ.

3. Shot Execution: As they reach the other side of the net post, the player attempts to hit the ball before it crosses the net. This typically involves a quick and compact swinging motion to angle the ball away from their opponent and into the open court.

The Erne is a high-risk, high-reward shot. When executed successfully, it can catch opponents off guard, allowing the player to put the ball away for a winner. However, it is a challenging shot that requires precise timing, agility, and anticipation. Attempting the Erne shot also involves the risk of making an error, such as hitting the net or sending the ball out of bounds.

It is important to note that the Erne is considered an advanced and unconventional shot in pickleball and is not recommended for Beginners or players who are still developing their skills. It is more commonly seen in higher-level play, where players have the experience and agility to attempt and execute this shot effectively.

#### 6.5.2 Defending the Erne
Defending against the Erne in pickleball requires anticipation, awareness, and strategic positioning. The Erne is an aggressive play where a player jumps from outside the court to hit a volley around the post or over the NVZ without touching it.

Key elements to defending the Erne include:

1. Awareness of the Opponent's Position: Keep an eye on your opponents. If you notice an opponent moving wide of the court or preparing to leap for an Erne, be ready to adjust your shot.

2. Avoid Predictable Shots: Players often execute the Erne in response to predictable, soft shots like a dink. Vary your shots, incorporating different speeds and directions to keep your opponent from setting up for the Erne.

3. Use Deeper Shots: Hit your shots deeper into the opponent's court. A deeper shot makes it more difficult for your opponent to move forward and execute the Erne effectively.

4. Target the Opposite Side: If you see an opponent positioning for an Erne on one side, aim your shots to the opposite side of the court. This forces the player to abandon the Erne setup and move back into position.

5. Speed Up the Ball: Consider speeding up your shots (a hard, low drive) instead of playing a soft game. Faster shots give your opponent less time to set up for an Erne.

6. Low and Tight Over the Net: Keep your shots low and tight over the net. A low shot is harder to volley aggressively and decreases the effectiveness of the Erne.

7. Communication in Doubles: If playing doubles, communicate with your partner. If one of you identifies the potential for an Erne, let the other know so both of you can adjust your play.

8. Watch for the Non-Volley Zone Violation: An Erne can be a high-risk shot. Watch closely; if the opponent touches the NVZ or the line during the attempt, it is a fault.

9. Practice Defensive Positioning: Work on your court positioning and movement to be able to quickly adapt to these aggressive plays.

10. Stay Calm and Focused: Do not panic if your opponent attempts an Erne. Staying calm and focused helps you react more effectively.

Defending the Erne is about being observant and flexible in your play. By recognizing your opponent's intentions and adjusting your strategy accordingly, you can effectively neutralize this aggressive tactic.

## 7. Advanced Strategies

### 7.1 Creating Opportunities in the Middle

#### 7.1.1 Dinking to the Middle
There are several benefits to dinking to the middle of the court in pickleball:

1. Control: Dinking to the middle of the court allows you to maintain control of the rally. By hitting the ball to the middle, you make it harder for your opponents to hit aggressive shots or angles, forcing them to hit a more defensive shot.

2. Splitting the Opponents: When you dink to the middle, you force your opponents to move and make a decision on who should take the shot. This can create confusion and miscommunication between them, increasing the chances of an error or a weak return.

3. Neutralizing the Angles: Hitting to the middle takes away the opportunity for your opponents to hit sharp angles. This reduces the risk of them hitting winners or putting you in a difficult defensive position.

4. Setting up for a Put-Away Shot: Dinking to the middle can set up a better opportunity for a put-away shot. By hitting to the middle, you can predict the next shot coming back to the same area, which you can then attack and put away for a winner.

5. Minimizing Risk: Dinking to the middle is generally a lower-risk shot compared to hitting aggressive shots down the line or cross-court. It reduces the chances of hitting the ball out or into the net, allowing you to maintain a consistent and steady rally.

Overall, dinking to the middle of the court in pickleball can help you maintain control, create confusion for your opponents, neutralize angles, set up for a put-away shot, and minimize risk. It is a strategic shot that can help you gain an advantage in the rally.

#### 7.1.2 Using the Outside Quadrants to Open the Middle
In pickleball, dinking to the outside quarters of the court is a strategic move that aims to open up the middle of the court.

Key elements to using the outside of the court to open up the middle are:

1. Dinking to the outside quarters of the court forces your opponents to move towards the sidelines. This movement makes it more challenging for them to cover the middle of the court effectively.

2. By consistently dinking to the outside quarters, you create a pattern that your opponents may start to anticipate. This predictability can lead them to focus more on the outside areas, inadvertently leaving the middle of the court more open.

3. As your opponents move toward the sidelines, they may also be forced to hit the ball at a more acute angle. This can result in weaker shots, giving you and your partner a better opportunity to take control of the point.

4. Once your opponents are positioned towards the sidelines, you can exploit the open space in the middle of the court by hitting a drop shot or a lob. This will force your opponents to move towards the middle, creating an opportunity for you and your partner to hit a winning shot.

In summary, dinking to the outside quarters of the court in pickleball is an effective strategy to open up the middle of the court. It forces your opponents to move towards the sidelines, making it more difficult for them to cover the middle effectively. This, in turn, creates opportunities for you and your partner to take control of the point and potentially win the rally.

### 7.2 Transition Zone Strategy

#### 7.2.1 3rd Shot Drive

##### 7.2.1.1 Technique
The 3rd shot drive technique refers to the specific method or skill set employed to execute a 3rd shot as a drive. The 3rd shot is a key moment in a pickleball rally, occurring after the serve and return. When a player opts for a drive, they are choosing to hit the ball fast and low over the net, aiming towards the opponents' feet or, at a minimum, below the opponents' shoulders or waist.

Key aspects of the 3rd shot drive technique include:

1. Stance and Positioning: Having a balanced, ready stance that allows for quick, powerful movements. Positioning yourself correctly on the court is crucial for effectively striking the ball.

2. Grip and Paddle Angle: Holding the paddle correctly to ensure control and power in the shot. The angle of the paddle at the point of contact influences the trajectory and speed of the ball.

3. Stroke Mechanics: This involves the movement of the arm and body to generate power. A fluid, controlled swing that starts from the shoulder, with the paddle head following through in the direction of the target, is key.

4. Point of Contact: Striking the ball at an optimal point, usually out in front of the body, helps in controlling direction and pace.

5. Follow-Through: A proper follow-through ensures the desired pace and direction of the drive, contributing to both power and accuracy.

6. Strategic Intent: Understanding when and why to use a drive over other shot options, such as a drop shot, is part of the technique. It involves reading the game and the opponents' positioning.

7. Consistency and Control: Being able to consistently execute this shot with control, especially under pressure, is a hallmark of good technique.

Developing a solid 3rd shot drive technique in pickleball can significantly enhance a player's effectiveness on the court, offering a powerful tool to transition from the baseline into a more advantageous net position.

##### 7.2.1.2 Consistency
3rd shot drive consistency refers to the ability to repeatedly execute the 3rd shot drive with reliability and precision. In the context of pickleball, the 3rd shot is a critical play usually made by the serving team after the return of serve. When players opt for a drive (a fast, low shot), maintaining consistency means they can regularly hit this shot with control, keeping it low over the net and deep into the opponent's court or hard at a specific target.

Consistent 3rd shot drives put pressure on the opponents, forcing them to respond to continuous aggressive shots. This consistency is key in establishing control in the rally, as it helps in transitioning from the baseline to the net, a strategic position in pickleball.

Players who can consistently deliver effective 3rd shot drives are often more successful in dictating the pace and flow of the game.

##### 7.2.1.3 Accuracy
3rd shot drive accuracy refers to the precision and effectiveness of the third shot hit in a rally, typically executed by the serving team. This shot is crucial as it sets the tone for the remainder of the point. The 3rd shot can be a drive, which is a fast, low shot aimed deep into the opponents' court. The accuracy of this drive is key, as it must be well-placed to challenge the receiving team while minimizing the risk of errors or easy counterattacks. A precise 3rd shot drive can force the opponents out of position, create openings for subsequent shots, or transition the serving team to the net.

3rd shot drive accuracy refers to the precision and effectiveness of the third shot when executed as a drive. This shot is crucial as it is the one following the serve and the return of serve, often setting the tone for the rest of the rally. When players choose to perform a drive for their third shot, they are hitting the ball fast and low over the net towards the opponents' court.

Accuracy in this context means:

1. Precise Placement: The ability to place the ball exactly where intended, whether that's deep in the opponents' court, targeting specific weak points, or keeping it away from their strengths.

2. Controlled Depth and Trajectory: Ensuring the ball travels at the right height over the net and lands in the desired location, balancing the need to challenge opponents with the risk of making errors.

3. Tactical Effectiveness: Using the drive not just as a forceful shot but as a strategic tool to create opportunities, disrupt the opponents' positioning, or transition into a favorable position for the next shot.

4. Consistency under Pressure: Maintaining accuracy even in high-pressure situations or during prolonged rallies.

Accurate 3rd shot drives in pickleball can significantly influence the game's dynamics, forcing opponents into defensive positions and opening up the court for advantageous plays.

##### 7.2.1.4 Placement
Hitting it down the line refers to hitting the ball in a straight path, parallel to one of the sidelines of the court. When a player hits a shot "down the line," they aim to send the ball over the net and close to the sideline.

Hitting the ball down the line can be an effective strategy in pickleball for several reasons:

1. Surprise Element: It can catch your opponents off guard, as they may not expect a shot directed towards the sideline rather than towards the middle of the court. The ball will maintain more speed while traveling in a straight line vs on the diagonal, therefore, minimizing the amount of time the opponent has to react.

2. Reduced Court Coverage: It forces your opponents to cover more ground, as they need to move quickly to defend the shot near the sideline. This can create openings on the court for subsequent shots. This tactic is most applicable in singles play.

3. Minimized Angle for Return: Hitting down the line limits the angle at which your opponents can return the ball. It may make it more challenging for them to execute an angled shot in response.

4. Higher Risk/Reward: While hitting down the line can be a powerful offensive move, it also carries some risk, as the margin for error is smaller due to the proximity to the sideline. If the shot is too wide, it can result in an out-of-bounds error.

Players often use down-the-line shots to finish points or set up an advantageous position in the rally. However, it is essential to practice these shots and use them strategically, as they can be high-risk shots that require

## 3. Grip Techniques

### 3.1 General
The grip used to hold the paddle is a fundamental aspect of playing pickleball effectively for several reasons:

1. Control and Accuracy: A proper grip allows for greater control and accuracy in your shots. It helps in precisely directing the ball, whether you are serving, volleying, or hitting groundstrokes.
2. Power: While pickleball does not rely on power as much as other racquet sports, a good grip can still help in generating more force in your shots, especially for smashes and drives.
3. Reduced Risk of Injury: An appropriate grip can reduce the strain on your wrist, elbow, and shoulder. This is particularly important for avoiding conditions like tennis elbow, which can occur from repetitive strain.
4. Versatility in Shots: A good grip enables you to easily switch between different types of shots, like from a forehand to a backhand, or transitioning from a groundstroke to a volley.
5. Spin: For advanced players, a proper grip is essential for applying different spins to the ball, adding another level of strategy to the game.
6. Comfort: A grip that feels natural and comfortable can improve your overall performance and enjoyment of the game.

To master pickleball, it is important to experiment with different grip styles (like Continental or Eastern) to find what works best for your style of play and ensures comfort during long matches. Regular practice with the correct grip will significantly improve your game.

### 3.2 The Continental Grip
The Continental grip in pickleball is a versatile and widely used grip, especially useful for a variety of shots. It is often referred to as the "hammer grip" due to the way the paddle is held, similar to holding a hammer.

Here are the key elements:

1. Grip Formation: To achieve the Continental grip, place your hand on the paddle handle so that the base knuckle of your index finger and the heel of your hand are aligned with the second bevel of the paddle handle. For a right-handed player, this would be at the 2 o'clock position on the paddle handle, and for a left-handed player, at the 10 o'clock position.

2. Characteristics: This grip aligns the paddle perpendicular to the ground and parallel to the net when your arm is extended. It allows for easy transitions between forehand and backhand strokes without the need to change the grip.

3. Advantages: The Continental grip is particularly effective for serves, volleys, and overhead smashes in pickleball. It provides a natural and balanced position for hitting the ball flat and straight, making it ideal for quick, reflex volleys at the net.

4. Versatility: While the Continental grip offers great control for specific shots, it might be less effective for powerful groundstrokes, where grips like the Eastern might be more suitable. However, its ease of use for both forehand and backhand strokes makes it a favorite among players who prefer a quick and reactive play style, especially in doubles.

5. Transition and Adaptability: Due to its neutral nature, the Continental grip allows players to quickly switch between different types of shots, making it a great choice for fast-paced games where quick reactions are crucial.

In summary, the Continental grip is a fundamental and versatile grip in pickleball, known for its effectiveness in serving, volleying, and smashes. Its balanced and neutral positioning makes it a great choice for players looking for a grip that works well with a variety of shots, especially in fast-paced play scenarios.

### 3.3 The Eastern Grip
The Eastern grip in pickleball is a commonly used grip that offers a good balance between power and control, especially for forehand shots.

Here are the key elements:

1. Positioning: To achieve the Eastern grip, place the palm of your dominant hand so that the base knuckle of your index finger is aligned with the third bevel of the paddle handle. If you imagine the handle as the face of a clock, this would be at the 3 o'clock position for a right-handed player and 9 o'clock for a left-handed player.

2. Grip Formation: The grip is similar to shaking hands with the paddle. Your fingers should be comfortably wrapped around the handle, and the thumb should be placed flat against the other side of the handle.

3. Advantages: The Eastern grip is particularly effective for forehand strokes. It allows for a natural and powerful swing motion and facilitates hitting the ball with a flat paddle face, which is great for driving the ball with power. It also offers a degree of flexibility that enables players to easily switch to other shots or grips as needed.

4. Forehand Orientation: When using the Eastern grip for a forehand shot, the paddle face will be perpendicular to the ground at the point of contact, which helps in achieving depth and power in the shots.

5. Versatility: While the Eastern grip is favored for forehand shots, players can still use it for other types of strokes with some adjustments. However, some players may prefer to switch to a different grip, like the Continental, for backhand strokes or specific shots like dinks or lobs.

In summary, the Eastern grip in pickleball is a popular choice for players who prefer a powerful and controlled forehand stroke. Its natural, handshake-like positioning makes it a comfortable grip for many players, especially those transitioning from sports like tennis.

### 3.4 The V-Shape Grip
The V-Shape grip in pickleball, also known as the "V-Grip," is a specific way of holding the paddle that is quite popular among players.

Here are the key elements:

1. Formation of the V-Shape Grip: This grip is named for the V-Grip formed between the thumb and the index finger on the paddle handle. When you grip the paddle, the base of your thumb and the side of your index finger create a V-Grip.

2. Position on the Paddle: The V-Grip should align with the edge of the paddle. This alignment helps in maintaining a neutral position, which is beneficial for both forehand and backhand shots.

3. Benefits: The V-Grip is known for providing a good balance of control and power. It allows for easier wrist movement, which is crucial for imparting spin and for quick, responsive shots. This grip is especially useful for players who prefer a more finesse-oriented game, as it offers excellent control over the angle of the paddle face and the direction of the ball.

4. Usage: This grip is used primarily for baseline strokes and serves. It is less common for net play or dinking, where a Continental grip might be more effective.

5. Adaptability: While the V-Grip is a fundamental grip in pickleball, players often adjust their grip slightly depending on the shot they are executing. For example, they might shift to a more forehand or backhand dominant grip when necessary.

In summary, the V-Shape Grip is a versatile and popular grip in pickleball, offering a good mix of control and power, and is especially effective for baseline play and serves. As with any sport, the choice of grip can be highly personal and depends on the style of play, comfort, and the specific demands of the game.

## 5. Opening the Lesson

### 5.1 Introduction
Here is where the coach will facilitate introductions allowing players several minutes each to tell their name, from where they traveled or where they live, any pre-existing injuries, and a little about past sports history, if any. From there, the coach will move into the warm-up.

### 5.2 Warm-Up

#### 5.2.1 Athlete Activation
To activate an athlete means to prepare them physically and mentally before a sports event or training session. The activation process is aimed at priming the athlete's body and mind for optimal performance. It typically involves a series of exercises, drills, and activities that increase heart rate, enhance focus, mobilize muscles, and improve overall readiness.

Physical activation generally involves dynamic movements like jumping, running, or agility exercises to warm up muscles, increase blood flow, and improve flexibility. This helps prevent injuries, increase range of motion, and optimize performance during the event.

An example of physical athlete activation is to have players jog from the baseline to the net starting at 20% effort and then back to the baseline from the net at 40% effort and then from the baseline to the net again but this time at 60% effort and then from the net to the baseline again, this time at 100% effort. One could also have players do jumping jacks or skip rope for a more dynamic start. This will engage the athletes and begin to get their heart rate up and their blood pumping!

#### 5.2.2 Dynamic Stretching
Warming up properly before playing pickleball is crucial to prepare your body for the physical activity, enhance performance, and reduce the risk of injuries. Perform dynamic stretches to improve mobility and flexibility. Focus on major muscle groups such as legs, arms, back, and shoulders.

Here are some examples of dynamic stretches:

1. Hip Openers (open and closed)
2. Arm Circles
3. Torso Twists
4. 60-40% Lunges
5. Monster Walks
6. Butt Kicks

#### 5.2.3 Athletic Skill Build
To build or reinforce an athletic skill, have students toss and catch a decompressed tennis ball from the area of the court as a part of the overall warm-up.

#### 5.2.4 Paddle Hits
Start with gentle dinking at the net, gradually moving back to the baseline. Practice a variety of shots including dinks, volleys, 3rd shot drops and drives, serves, and return of serve gradually increasing intensity.

A common paddle warm-up could include the following components:

1. Shadow swings: Mimic pickleball strokes using your paddle without a ball. Perform forehand and backhand swings, emphasizing proper technique and incorporating footwork.
2. Forehand and Backhand Dinks: Practice hitting soft, controlled shots (dinks) off both sides with a focus on consistency and accuracy.
3. Volley Drills: Work on volleys near the net by practicing quick reflexes, soft hands and proper paddle positioning. This is typically done with a partner or against a wall.
4. 3rd Shot Drops/Drives: Work on hitting 3rd shot drops from the baseline to the Non-Volley Zone, aiming to land the ball softly and close to the net or low enough that the partner has to hit up on the shot.
5. Serve and Return of Serve Practice: Players work on their serve technique and practice returning serves with a focus on consistency and accuracy.

It is important to note that the specific warm up routine may vary depending on individual preferences and skill levels. The goal of a paddle warm up is to prepare the body and mind for pickleball play, reduce the risk of injuries, and improve overall performance on the court.

Once the paddle warm-up is complete, coaches will put players in OPEN competitive play. This will provide the coach with an opportunity to observe students in a score-keeping game situation. It is important that this be competitive so that the coach can do a true skill assessment of all players.

## 6. Skill Development

This section represents the CLOSED section of the Hourglass format where we will introduce and teach several shots that are appropriate for players moving from the 3.5 to 4.0 level.

### 6.1 Swing Volley
This is a dynamic shot that combines elements of both a volley and a groundstroke. The Swing Volley is hit out of the air with a full swing, usually while standing near the NVZ. This is a versatile shot that can be used to put pressure on the opponents, create angles, or hit winners.

#### 6.1.1 Technique
Swing Volley technique in pickleball is crucial for effectively hitting the ball out of the air before it bounces on the court. This shot is typically executed near the net, typically at or close to the NVZ, but it can also be hit when transitioning. In pickleball, the volley is typically referred to as a "Swing Volley" vs a "Punch Volley" due to the rules of the game and the restrictions of the NVZ. However, there are times when the height of the ball allows for more punch than swing on a volley.

Proper swing volley technique involves several key components for both control and power:

1. Position: Stand with your knees slightly bent, weight on the balls of your feet, and paddle held in front of you at chest level. This position allows for quick movements and reactions.

2. Grip and Paddle Position: Hold the paddle with a firm yet relaxed grip. The paddle face should be open (angled slightly upwards) for most volleys to ensure the ball clears the net.

3. Minimal Backswing: Unlike groundstrokes, volleys require very little backswing. The power comes from the speed of the ball and a firm, controlled movement of the paddle.

4. Paddle Movement: Use a short, slight swinging motion for the volley. The movement is more about guiding the ball rather than winding up and swinging hard.

5. Contact Point: Make contact with the ball in front of your body. This helps with accuracy and control.

6. Follow Through: Keep the follow-through short and controlled. Overextending can lead to loss of control over the shot. Return to neutral to be prepared for the next shot.

7. Non-Dominant Hand: Use your body to add power to the volley, especially for aggressive volleys. This involves a slight forward movement of the body and a transfer of weight from the back foot to the front foot.

8. Shot Placement: Aim your volleys deliberately, whether you are trying to hit them away from your opponent or into difficult-to-reach areas.

9. Quick Feet: Good footwork is essential. Be ready to move quickly to position yourself optimally for each volley.

10. Anticipation and Reaction: Be alert and ready to react quickly to your opponents' shots, as volleys often occur in fast-paced exchanges. Mastering volley technique is essential for success in pickleball, especially in aggressive net play. It allows a player to take charge of the rally, creating opportunities for winning points and putting pressure on the opponents.

#### 6.1.2 Consistency
Volley consistency refers to the ability to reliably and effectively execute volley shots throughout a game or match. Consistency in volleying is crucial for maintaining control during rallies and effectively countering the opponents' play.

Key elements of volley consistency include:

1. Controlled Shot Placement: Regularly placing volleys accurately, whether it is directing them to specific areas of the court to challenge opponents or keeping them away from opponents' strengths. As the level of play increases, consistency evolves from number of shots in the court to number of shots to a specific target.

2. Steady Paddle Work: Maintaining a firm wrist and stable paddle face when contacting the ball, which is essential for controlling the direction and speed of the volley.

3. Positioning and Footwork: Being in the right position to effectively volley, which often means staying close to the NVZ line. Good footwork is essential for quick adjustments.

4. Adaptability: The ability to adjust volleys based on the pace and angle of the incoming ball, as well as to the positioning and playing style of the opponents.

5. Reduced Errors: Consistently executing volleys without faults like hitting the ball into the net or out of bounds.

6. Strategic Awareness: Understanding when to use a soft, controlled volley to reset the point or a hard, aggressive volley to take control of the rally.

Developing volley consistency is important for pickleball players at all skill levels, as it provides a reliable foundation for both defensive and offensive play at the net. A player who can consistently volley well is often able to dictate the pace and flow of the game.

#### 6.1.3 Accuracy
Volley accuracy refers to the precision with which a player executes their volley shots. Accuracy in volleying is crucial for placing the ball effectively to challenge opponents, control the point, and minimize the risk of unforced errors.

Key aspects of volley accuracy include:

1. Precise Placement: Skillfully directing the ball to targeted areas of the court, whether it is to exploit an opponents' weaknesses, keep opponents off-balance, or set up for a winning shot.

2. Controlled Angles: The ability to manage the angle of the paddle and the point of contact to guide the ball accurately, whether for cross-court shots, down-the-line shots, or sharp angles.

3. Depth Control: The ability to hit the volley with enough depth to make it challenging for opponents to return, but with the control needed to keep the ball in play.

4. Strategic Shot Selection: Choosing the right type of volley (soft touch volley to drop the ball in the kitchen, or a hard drive volley for an aggressive play) based on the dynamics of the rally and the positioning of the opponents.

5. Adjusting to Ball Speed and Spin: Modifying the volley technique to accommodate the incoming ball pace and spin, ensuring accurate returns.

6. Consistency Under Pressure: Maintaining accuracy even in high-pressure situations or during fast-paced exchanges at the net.

Improving volley accuracy is important for players looking to enhance their performance in pickleball, as it allows for more control over rallies and increases the likelihood of winning points through strategic shot placement.

#### 6.1.4 Blocking
Blocking refers to a defensive shot used to neutralize an opponent's powerful or aggressive shot, particularly a smash or a hard-driven ball. The goal of a block shot is to absorb the power of the incoming ball and return it gently over the net, ideally placing it in a way that makes it difficult for the opponent to attack again. This shot is crucial when you are at the net and need to defend against fast-paced volleys or smashes. Key aspects of blocking in pickleball include:

1. Soft Hands: Relaxing your grip on the paddle and using soft hands is essential. This allows the paddle to absorb some of the energy from the ball, reducing the speed as it rebounds.

2. Paddle Position: Keep your paddle up and in front of you, positioned between your body and the net. This ready position allows for quick reaction to fast shots.

3. Minimal Movement: A block shot requires very little paddle movement. It is more about positioning the paddle correctly and allowing the ball to hit the paddle, rather than swinging at the ball.

4. Angle of the Paddle: Slightly angle the paddle face upwards to ensure the ball clears the net. The angle also helps to control the direction of the block volley.

5. Body Position: Stay balanced with your knees slightly bent. Move your body as a unit to align with the ball, rather than just reaching with your arm.

6. Strategic Placement: Aim to place your block shot where it will be most challenging for the opponent to attack again, often in the NVZ or at their feet.

7. Controlled Follow Through: The follow-through should be minimal to maintain control over the shot.

8. Quick Recovery: After executing the block, be prepared to quickly respond to the next shot, as effective blocking often leads to continued volley exchanges.

Blocking is a skill that requires practice, as it involves precise timing and control, especially when dealing with powerful shots. Mastering this technique can significantly enhance your defensive play in pickleball.

#### 6.1.5 Counter Attack
Counter attacking refers to the strategy of responding aggressively to an opponent's attack, turning a defensive situation into an offensive opportunity. This involves quickly and decisively returning a strong shot from an opponent, often catching them off-guard and potentially winning the point.

Key aspects of counter attacking in pickleball include:

1. Quick Reaction: Counter attacking requires fast reflexes to respond to an incoming aggressive shot from the opponent.

2. Strategic Placement: Aim your counter attack where it is most difficult for the opponent to return, such as at their feet, in open court areas, or toward the weaker side.

3. Using Opponent's Pace: A counter-attack often involves using the speed of the opponent's shot to your advantage. By effectively redirecting this power, you can create a strong return with less physical effort.

4. Paddle Readiness: Keep your paddle up and in a ready position, allowing for a quick transition from a defensive to an offensive shot.

5. Body Positioning: The ability to stay balanced and ready to move. Good footwork is crucial in positioning yourself optimally for a counter-attack.

6. Shot Selection: Decide quickly whether to use a hard drive, a volley, or a more strategic placement shot as your counter-attack.

7. Mental Composure: Maintain focus and calmness during high-pressure situations, as counter-attacking often occurs during fast-paced exchanges.

8. Aggressive Play: Counter attacking is an assertive strategy. It requires confidence and the willingness to take risks during critical moments in the game.

Effective counter attacking in pickleball can shift the momentum of a point, putting pressure back on the opponent and often leading to winning shots. It is a skill that combines technical ability with strategic awareness and mental agility.

#### 6.1.6 Handling Power
Handling power when volleying in pickleball refers to effectively managing and responding to powerful volleys from your opponents. It involves techniques and strategies to control and neutralize these fast, forceful shots rather than being overwhelmed by them. This skill is crucial in maintaining a competitive edge during high-paced exchanges at the net.

Key aspects of handling power while volleying include:

1. Soft Hands: This means using a relaxed grip and a gentle touch to absorb the power of the incoming shot, reducing its speed as you return it. Think of the paddle as a cushion that deadens the impact.

2. Paddle Positioning: Keeping the paddle up and in front of you, ready to quickly react to powerful shots. Good anticipation and preparation are essential.

3. Body Position and Balance: Maintaining a balanced, stable stance allows for quick, controlled movements. Positioning your body effectively to intercept powerful volleys is crucial.

4. Short, Controlled Strokes: Instead of a full swing, use short, compact strokes to return powerful volleys. This helps in maintaining control over the return shot.

5. Block Volleys: A block volley is a defensive shot where the paddle is used to block the ball back into the opponent's court, using the power of the incoming shot to your advantage.

6. Angle and Placement: Redirect the power of the shot by angling your paddle, sending the ball away from the opponent or into difficult areas of the court.

7. Strategic Depth: Aim your volleys deep in the opponents' court or softly into the NVZ, depending on the situation. Depth can help neutralize the advantage of a power volley especially when in transition.

8. Mental Composure: Stay calm and focused. Handling power volleys well often requires quick thinking and adaptability under pressure.

Handling power when volleying effectively is a blend of technical skill, strategic thinking, and mental composure. It is about using the incoming power/pace to your advantage, either by neutralizing their shots or redirecting the shots in ways that challenge the opponents in return.

### 6.2 The Lob

#### 6.2.1 Technique
Lob technique refers to the specific method and skills used to execute a lob shot effectively. A lob is a strategic play where the ball is hit in a high arc over the opponents, ideally landing deep in their court. Proper technique is crucial for making the lob a successful and reliable part of the game.

Key aspects of good lob technique include:

1. Stance and Footwork: Start with a balanced stance, ready to step into the shot. Good footwork is essential to position yourself correctly for the lob.

2. Grip and Paddle Positioning: Hold the paddle with a relaxed grip. The paddle face should be open (tilted slightly backwards) to create the necessary lift and arc.

3. Backswing and Point of Contact: A smooth, controlled backswing helps in generating the right amount of power. The ball should be struck in front of your body, with the point of contact being slightly under the ball to lift it.

4. Upward Swing Path: Swing the paddle in an upward motion, imparting both forward momentum and lift to the ball. This creates the high arc needed for the lob.

5. Follow Through: A proper follow-through is critical. Continue the upward motion of your swing after hitting the ball, guiding it on the desired path.

6. Visual and Tactical Awareness: Be aware of your opponents' positions. The best time to hit a lob is typically when they are close to the net and may not have enough time to backtrack.

7. Control and Precision: Practice controlling the depth and height of the lob. The goal is to make it land deep in the opponents' court without going out of bounds.

8. Adjusting to Conditions: Be ready to adjust your lob technique based on factors like wind, the style of play, and your position on the court.

Developing a solid lob technique can be a game-changer in pickleball, providing a strategic tool to counter aggressive net play and to create opportunities for offensive shots.

#### 6.2.2 Consistency
Lob consistency refers to the ability to reliably and effectively execute lob shots over the course of a game or match. Lobbing consistently means being able to perform this shot effectively under various conditions and throughout the duration of play.

Achieving consistency in lob shots involves several key aspects:

1. Accurate Placement: Regularly placing the lob where it is intended, such as deep in the opponents' court, away from their reach.

2. Controlled Arc and Depth: Ensuring the ball travels with the right trajectory – high enough to clear the opponents, but not so
